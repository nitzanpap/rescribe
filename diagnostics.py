"""What a recording knew about itself, written down before it is forgotten.

Every fault in this project so far was diagnosed by hand, afterwards, from a file
and a person's memory — and each time the thing that would have answered it in a
second had existed and been thrown away. The recording's own log, holding the
helper's every word and the exact ffmpeg commands, lives in memory and dies with
the scratch directory. Which device was actually opened is never written anywhere:
the Teams-loopback fault cost hours because nobody could see that the computer's
side had been pointed at a driver carrying nothing. The measured levels are taken
at save time and used for one warning and then dropped. Whether a channel has
holes in it was never asked at all, and that is the fault that has now been found
twice by ear.

So this takes one pass over the finished recording, adds what only the recorder
knew, and appends a line to `recordings.jsonl` beside the job history. It is
written after the .m4a is safely in place and never allowed to fail the recording:
a diagnostic that can lose somebody's meeting is worse than no diagnostic.
