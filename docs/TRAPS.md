# Traps

Everything here cost real time, most of it more than once. It is written for
whoever works on this next — very likely an AI agent — because none of it is
guessable from reading the code, and several entries are things the code looks
correct without.

Ordered by how much they cost.

---

## 1. The absence of a signal is not evidence

This is the trap this project keeps falling into, in a new costume each time.

- A microphone recording digital zero looked exactly like a quiet room.
- A refused audio tap looked exactly like a machine playing nothing: both deliver
  no callbacks at all.
- ffmpeg buffers its output, so a working capture leaves a WAV at nought bytes for
  tens of seconds. That silence was read as failure, and a working recording was
  refused.
- A capture that stalled for 31 seconds looked healthy, because the meter was
  showing the last value it had been handed and nothing was checking when.

Three separate confident diagnoses were wrong for this reason, and in two of them
the owner was right and the machine's silence was meaningless.

**The cure is not more careful watching. It is making the signal yourself.** Play
a tone and ask whether it comes back. That is exactly what *Check it works* does,
and it is why the check plays its own sound instead of waiting for the user to
speak. Every real bug found on 2026-07-31 was found this way; none were found by
reading code.

## 2. Do not capture audio with ffmpeg on macOS

**ffmpeg's `avfoundation` input hands over about 86% of the samples the device
produces.** Steadily, not in bursts. Its own log accounts for every packet it was
given — `994 packets read, 0 decode errors` — with packets holding 512 samples
(10.67 ms of audio) but arriving every 12.07 ms. The samples never reach it.

The same device through Core Audio: **0.990**, where the missing 1% is the moment
before the first buffer.

Ruled out, so nobody re-tests them: `-drop_late_frames` (defaults true, changed
nothing — 0.860 against 0.863), a mislabelled sample rate (ffmpeg and the system
both report 48000), and the metering filters (a bare capture is equally short).

Capture is `mac/syscapture.swift` now, for both sides. ffmpeg still mixes the
finished files at the end, which is offline work on complete files with no clock
to keep up with, and still does everything on Linux.

**The general lesson:** when a measurement says a device is behaving strangely,
measure the same device through a second, independent path before believing
anything about the device.

## 3. A fix can turn an invisible fault into a visible one

`aresample=async=1` was added to keep the timeline honest, and it did. It also
made the sample loss above *audible* for the first time — twelve gaps of 106 ms
in ten seconds, one every 0.83 s — because the holes it faithfully filled were
real holes that had previously been closed up.

Before: continuous-sounding audio, an eighth short, drifting seven minutes an hour
away from the other channel. After: correct timing, audible chopping.

**Ask what the person actually experiences, not only whether the numbers improved.**
A correct fix that makes the product worse is a regression, and the owner is the
one who will hear it first.

## 4. macOS permissions attach to a binary, and a rebuild changes the binary

Every build changes the code hash, so macOS stops recognising grants. The rows in
System Settings go on looking exactly like working ones — the app is *refused
while appearing to be allowed*. `rebuild.sh` resets them deliberately so it asks
again, which is the only honest state.

Consequences that have each bitten:

- **Do not start a recording immediately after `rebuild.sh`.** The permission
  prompts are still being answered while it runs, and the measurement is worthless.
  Do a throwaway recording first, confirm both sides report a level, then measure.
- **The build directory bundle is a second app.** Spotlight indexes
  `target/release/bundle/macos/`, so it appeared beside the installed one in every
  search — a different binary with its own permission identity, one keystroke away
  from being opened instead of the real one. `rebuild.sh` deletes it after
  installing.
- Running the helper from a shell is **not** the same program as the app running
  it. It will be refused, silently, and deliver digital zeros.

## 5. Never write "not found" over a remembered setting

Clearing the microphone grant made the device listing come back empty. The empty
answer was then saved over a good remembered choice — after which every recording
was the computer's side alone, with nothing said on it and no error anywhere.

**A device that cannot be seen at this moment keeps its name.** Absence of a
device in a listing is not a decision by the user.

## 6. Measurement tools have their own limits, and they lie quietly

- **`ebur128` momentary loudness cannot show speech.** It is defined over a 400 ms
  window, and 400 ms is about two syllables. On a tone switching on and off every
  200 ms it reported a flat −24.5 dB from beginning to end and never once dipped.
  A meter fed that is not slow — it is showing the wrong quantity. Peak over 50 ms
  windows tracks the same tone cleanly.
- **macOS Voice Isolation strips non-speech from the microphone.** A 1 kHz test
  tone played through the speakers produced *nothing* in the microphone channel,
  even bandpassed at the tone frequency. Test signals that must survive a
  microphone have to be speech — `say -o words.aiff "tick"` works.
- **`silencedetect` jitters by about ±10 ms.** Fine for locating a gap, not for
  measuring an offset. Use several events and take the mean spacing.
- **`ffmpeg -ss A -to B` does not measure the window you asked for.** It is the
  obvious way to ask "is this channel silent between A and B", and it answers about
  some other stretch. Checking a mute applied at 1.0–2.0 s and 9.0 s–end, it called
  the 9–10 s window fully audible where the samples there were digital zero — three
  spot checks, all agreeing, all wrong, and the conclusion drawn from them was that
  the feature was broken when it was not. Reading the samples directly took less
  code and was right the first time (§20). Two smaller versions of the same hazard
  sit beside it: **`-v error` suppresses `volumedetect`'s own output**, so a wrapper
  grepping for `max_volume` returns an empty string — which reads as silence, not as
  a broken measurement — and a peak taken over half-second buckets straddles the
  edge of the thing being measured, so the bucket either side of a boundary is never
  the value expected. Every one of these makes a working thing look broken, which is
  entry 1 read backwards and just as expensive.

## 7. A request that waits on a human needs a human's patience

*Transcribe a file* in the menu bar opened a picker, transcribed the chosen file
correctly, and looked like a menu item that did nothing — because the reply never
came back. The tray reads the backend over a hand-written socket with a twenty
second timeout, which is right for every call that answers at once and hopeless
for the one that answers when somebody has finished browsing. The socket gave up,
the window was never shown, and the job ran to completion unseen.

**Match the timeout to what is being waited for, not to the transport.** The
backend gives that dialog five minutes, so the caller now waits five and a half.

**And the symptom is worth remembering:** the work happened, correctly, with no
sign of it. When something "does nothing", check whether it did everything and
failed to say so — `/api/state` showed the finished job immediately.

## 8. Build only what is used, and prove the copy took

`tauri build` makes a `.app` and a `.dmg`. `rebuild.sh` installs the `.app` and has
never once touched the disk image — but building the DMG mounts a scratch volume
and opens the familiar drag-me-to-Applications Finder window, which looked enough
like an installer that the owner dragged the app across by hand after **every**
rebuild for a whole session. Nothing asked them to; the copy had already happened.

Worse, a DMG run that leaves its volume mounted makes *every later build fail*, at
a step nothing depends on, with an error pointing at bundling rather than at a
stray `/Volumes/dmg.XXXXXX`. It builds `--bundles app` now — no window, no volume,
half the bundling. `tauri build` still makes both for a real release.

If a build ever fails in `bundle_dmg.sh`, look for a mounted volume first:
`hdiutil info | grep image-path`, then `hdiutil detach /Volumes/dmg.XXXXXX -force`.

**And the copy into /Applications is now checked against the working tree**, not
only for a valid signature. Everything before it can pass while `/Applications`
still holds an older app — it is the one step whose failure looks exactly like
success, and this session spent time testing an app that was not the one just
built.

## 9. Verify the artefact you just made

A test reported a 52.9-second result for a 13.5-second recording. The recording
was correct; `ls -t ~/Recordings` had picked up an *older* file because the new one
had not been written yet. The number was reported before it was checked.

**Confirm the artefact's identity — its name, its timestamp — before drawing a
conclusion from it.** Waiting on a fixed `sleep` and then taking "the newest file"
is not a check. This one was written, then deleted by a careless slice edit while
adding the section above it, then restored — which is itself entry 11's last bullet.

## 10. A test that dies early hides everything behind it

The Linux CI job had been failing for many commits on `" ".join(None)` — the save
panel test asked the machine it was running on, and a Linux box without zenity has
no picker. Because the suite dies at that line, **the 600 checks after it had never
run on Linux at all**, and were hiding two real bugs.

- **State the platform, do not ask the machine.** The picker test now names the
  platform and whether zenity exists, so all three branches are exercised on every
  runner. The zenity branch had never been tested by anything, which is how it came
  to offer a transcript under the name of the settings file.
- **Reproduce CI locally.** `docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/w -w /w python:3.13-slim`
  gave the exact Ubuntu failure in seconds instead of a push-and-wait cycle — and
  then a second run *with ffmpeg installed*, which is what GitHub's image actually
  has, surfaced a second fault the bare container could not.

## 11. Encode the invariant, not the token

A check asserted `"aresample" not in cmd`, written after `aresample=async=1000`
reconciling two live devices destroyed the quieter channel. It was right to exist
and wrong in form: it also banned `aresample=async=1`, which only fills and trims
and is the one thing keeping the timeline honest.

**Ban the dangerous use, not the word.** The check now allows `async=1`, fails on
any stretching value, and says which use is which.

## 12. Translated markup must be parsed before the script that translates it

A Hebrew confirmation came with an English **Yes** and **Cancel** under it. The
keys existed in both dictionaries and `t("confirm.yes")` returned `כן` when asked —
but `applyTranslations()` runs as the scripts load, and the dialog was written
*below* the `<script>` tags, so it did not exist yet when the one pass over the
document happened. Switching language in-session would have fixed it, because that
calls `applyTranslations()` again; loading straight into Hebrew never did.

Two checks now cover the class rather than the instance: nothing carrying
`data-i18n` may appear after the first `<script src=`, and every key the page asks
for must exist in **both** dictionaries. A missing key falls through to English
silently, which is the same bug wearing a different hat.

**And never interpolate a backend word into a translated sentence.** The status of
an interrupted run went straight into `{was}`, so a Hebrew reader got
"…, cancelled." in the middle of their own language. Those words are translated
through `job.was.<status>` now, and the suite checks every status has both.

## 13. `from x import f` takes a copy, and a copy cannot be patched

Splitting `record.py` moved `system_audio` into `syshelper.py`, and `devices.py`
picked it up with `from syshelper import system_audio`. Every check still passed
except one, which failed for a reason that had nothing to do with the code: the
suite patches `syshelper.system_audio` to stand in for a machine with the helper
present, and the from-import had already taken its own binding of the old
function. The patch was writing to a name nothing read.

The failure here was loud, which was luck. The same mistake against a *constant*
would have been silent — the tests point `syshelper.HELPER_SOURCE` at a path that
does not exist so that nothing tries to compile Swift, and a module holding a
stale copy would have gone on looking at the real one and passed anyway, testing
nothing.

**Import the module for anything that might be replaced; import the name only for
things that never move.** `devices.py` and `record.py` both call
`syshelper.system_audio()` through the module now, with the reason written beside
the import. Constants stay as plain from-imports.

**And when a refactor makes a suite pass, check it still has teeth.** Two things
were asked of this one: that it reported the same number of checks before and
after the split — 424 both times — and that deleting the patch line made a check
fail. It did.

## 14. A feature can run only on the path nobody takes

Recordings keep the two speakers in separate channels so the transcript can say
who said which line. That is the reason this app exists. It was not happening.

Building a two-track job existed in exactly one place — `saving.enqueue`, which
runs only when a recording is set to transcribe itself. That setting is off by
default, deliberately and correctly, because seizing the machine the instant a
meeting ends is the wrong thing to do. So the ordinary path — record now,
transcribe from the Library later — went through `make_job` with no tracks at
all and fell through to `ONE_TRACK`. The stereo file was downmixed to mono, both
people landed on top of each other, and whichever was louder at a given moment
was the only one transcribed.

Measured on three real recordings: every one came back
`tracks=[{channel: None}]`, with no `Me:` or `Them:` anywhere in the output.

**Two things hid it, and both are worth recognising again.**

The output looked fine. A mono transcript of a meeting is readable English — it
is simply missing half the conversation and all the attribution. Nothing is
empty, nothing errors, and the absence of a `Me:` prefix is not something anybody
notices in a wall of text. Hours went into measuring levels, dropouts,
bandwidth, modulation depth and channel correlation on those three files before
anybody read `tracks` in the history. **The capture was perfect the whole time.**

And the suite covered the wrong half. `the_whole_thing` drives a real recording
end to end and asserts on labels — through `record.enqueue`. It tested the path
that had the feature and never the path the user actually takes.

**Cures, in order of how much they would have saved.** When a feature has more
than one entry point, test the *default* one, not the convenient one. Assert on
the thing that distinguishes the feature — the label — rather than on output
existing. And when a symptom is about audio quality, read what the job was
actually asked to do before measuring the audio: `tracks` was one line of
history away the entire time.

## 15. Another app's loopback driver is not the computer's audio

Teams installs `MSLoopbackDriverDevice_UID`, Zoom installs
`zoom.us.zoomaudiodevice.001`. Both show up in the input listing, both answer to
`is_loopback`, and neither carries anything unless that app is routing into it.

The computer side's guess took the first loopback in the list. Our own tap is
appended *last* in `devices.py`, whose comment says being last makes it "the
computer side's first loopback" — true only on a machine with no other loopback
driver on it, which stopped being the common case the day the owner installed
Teams.

What it produced, on 2026-08-02: a recording that looks right and is not. Voice
channel −17.4 dB peak, computer channel −91.0 dB flat for the whole file, the job
recording `tracks: [{channel: null}]`, and no error anywhere. An idle loopback
driver is indistinguishable from a quiet room — entry 1 again, in a new costume.

**Read what the app actually selected before diagnosing anything else.**
`curl -s localhost:8765/api/record/devices` names both sides in one line. The
first suspicion here was the audio grant, which had just been cleared by a
rebuild and so was genuinely refused as well — two faults, and the loud one was
not the one that made the recording. Splitting the file per channel with
`volumedetect` is what separated them.

## 16. Ask the app before measuring the file

Three faults in a row were diagnosed by hand — a person listening, an agent
measuring the recording afterwards — and all three were questions the app knew
the answer to and had thrown away.

- *Which device was actually opened?* Never written down. The Teams-loopback
  fault (§15) cost hours because the answer was one unreadable id in settings.
- *How many tracks did the job have?* One line of `history.jsonl`. Instead an
  evening went on levels, dropouts, bandwidth, modulation depth and spectrograms
  of an audio file that turned out to be perfect (§14).
- *Are there holes in this channel?* Never asked at all. Found by ear, twice.

`diagnostics.py` writes a line per recording to `recordings.jsonl` now — devices
by name *and* id, which output the tap was built on, the levels, the stalls seen
live, holes measured in the finished file, the helper's exit code, and the log
that used to die with the scratch directory. `tools/diagnose.py` prints it, and
leads with the three questions above because those are the ones that go wrong.

**Run it first.** `python3 tools/diagnose.py` before measuring anything by hand.
`--backfill` reconstructs what is still recoverable from recordings made before
any of this existed; `--all` lists every recording with a clean/holes verdict.

**The general rule this is an instance of:** when a diagnosis needs a fact that
only existed at the moment of the fault, that fact is not a debugging detail, it
is part of the feature. Write it down while it is knowable.

## 17. A meter that moves is not a capture that works

A two-hour client meeting came back with the other side as gibberish, transcribed
as English though the client spoke Hebrew. Nothing warned anybody, and every
existing check said the recording was healthy: audio arrived continuously, the
meter moved, the file was full length, the levels were good, and the
signal-to-noise on that side measured 71 dB.

Half of it was silence. The capture had written padding in place of audio that
never came — in slivers under a millisecond, thousands a second — and `catchUp`
does exactly that by design, for gaps of any size down to a single sample. The
only message that existed fired for a single gap of **two seconds or more**, so
a capture destroying half of everything ran for two hours in silence.

**Three wrong turns worth not repeating.**

*The file cannot answer this.* Silence a tap delivered and silence invented to
stand in for it are the same bytes. Every measurement made from the recording —
levels, bandwidth, modulation depth, holes at 100 ms — said it was fine. Only the
capture knows, and it now says so: `syscapture: <side> padding 12.3s of 45.6s`,
every ten seconds, kept in the diagnostic record and shown on screen above 5%.

*Silence inside audio is not a fault by itself.* The hole detector reported a
231-second outage and called it the tap dying. It was the gap between one call
ending and the next beginning — nothing was playing. That reading was confidently
wrong, and the padding figures are what tell the two apart.

*Beware the tidy correlate.* The output device was Bluetooth, and Bluetooth is a
famously flaky path, so it got the blame. Then the owner said the damage stopped
partway through — same headphones throughout, Zoom for the first half and Google
Meet for the second, and only Zoom's audio was destroyed. The constant was not
the cause. **What changed is the cause; what stayed the same is not**, and the
owner usually knows what changed.

## 18. This project's own tooling

- **The suite runs against fake `ffmpeg` and `whisper-cli` stubs.** `ffprobe` echoes
  `123.5` for every duration. Any check that needs real audio must locate the real
  binary with `shutil.which` and skip when it is absent — do not assume the fakes.
- **`web/*.js` share one global scope.** A `const` declared twice is a redeclaration
  error that kills every file loaded after it, and checking files one at a time
  cannot see it. `rebuild.sh` concatenates them in page order and parses the result.
  This is how a second `LANGUAGE_NAMES` silently took `app.js` out.
- **`rebuild.sh` is the gate for anything in the desktop app.** Rust tests live
  there rather than in CI, because running them means building Tauri — minutes of
  webkit on a job that otherwise takes seconds.
- **Never edit a running bash script.** Bash reads scripts incrementally, so
  rewriting one mid-run shifts the byte offsets and kills the process at a random
  point. This orphaned an `afplay` that kept playing and a recording that kept
  running. `bash -n` passes before and after and cannot see it.

## 19. Things an agent working here cannot do

- **Screen capture and assistive access are both blocked.** `screencapture` fails
  with "could not create image from display", and System Events refuses with
  "osascript is not allowed assistive access", so nothing visual can be
  self-verified and no window control can be clicked. `tell application "…" to
  quit` does work, and so does reading the backend over HTTP — reach for those. A menu bar icon shipped as
  a black square because of this and the owner had to report it. **If a change is
  visual and cannot be rendered in the browser pane, say plainly that it is
  unverified rather than implying it was checked.**
- **A template menu bar image uses only the alpha channel.** Handing it the app icon
  puts a solid black square in the menu bar, because that is exactly what an opaque
  icon's alpha channel is. `desktop/src-tauri/icons/menubar.py` draws the glyph.
- **A Tauri tray with `show_menu_on_left_click(false)`** looks like a dead icon:
  the menu can then only be reached by right-click, which on a trackpad means two
  fingers, and control-click does not reach it either.

## 20. How to measure this app

The methods that produced every real answer, so they can be reused:

- **Two known signals, one moment.** Play a pattern through the speakers while
  recording both sides. The tap takes it digitally, the microphone acoustically,
  and any difference between the two channels is the captures disagreeing about
  time. Bursts exactly 2.000 s apart gave the drift (1.775 s recorded) and later
  proved it gone (1.995–2.000 s) and the channels aligned to the sample.
- **Let the tool stop itself.** `ffmpeg -t 20` taking 20.36 s of wall clock while
  producing 17.05 s of audio is what separated "the timestamps are wrong" from
  "the samples are missing". Signalling a process and measuring afterwards cannot
  make that distinction.
- **A stalling pipe reproduces a stall.** Feeding raw PCM through a shell that
  sleeps in the middle gives a deterministic gap without needing to sleep a Mac.
- **Compare against a second implementation.** Twelve lines of Swift measuring the
  same microphone through Core Audio is what proved the device was fine and the
  tool was not.
- **Read the samples, do not ask a tool about them.** `wave`, then
  `array.array("h")`, then `data[channel::2]`, then scan for runs under a threshold.
  Twelve lines, no seek semantics to get wrong, and it located a mute to 4.0107 s
  against 4.0 asked for. This is what to reach for whenever the question is "is this
  channel silent between A and B" — see §6 for what happens when it is asked of
  ffmpeg instead.

---

## The habit underneath all of it

State what you expect, measure it, and say which parts were verified and which
were inferred — in those words, so the difference is visible. Where a measurement
disagrees with the owner, suspect the measurement first: on this project it has
been wrong more often than they have.

---

## And the map

`docs/PIPELINE.md` traces sound from the microphone to a line in a transcript, and
lists every place a time is created, carried or invented. Two of those places
invent rather than carry — whisper's own segment times, and the VAD regions — and
every timestamp fault this project has had lives at one of them or where they meet.

Read it before changing anything between capture and the `.srt`.
