"""Recording: your voice and your computer's audio, into one file.

macOS hands an app the microphone or nothing — there is no system-audio input
device until a loopback driver (BlackHole and friends) provides one. And an
Aggregate Device does not help by itself: it *concatenates* channels rather than
mixing them, which is why recorders fed one come back with the mic alone.

So this opens two devices at once and does the mixing here, keeping the two
apart: your voice in the left channel, everything else in the right. That is
what makes a labelled transcript possible afterwards — each channel is
transcribed on its own, so who said a line is known rather than guessed.

The master is a WAV in scratch, not the .m4a that gets kept. A WAV's header
comes first, so a recording cut short by a crash is still playable; an .m4a
without its trailing index is nothing at all. Stopping transcodes it into place.

What is left in this file is the part that has to be here: the one recording
that exists at a time, the processes making it, and the state it moves through.
Everything that could be asked without a recording running was moved out, and
the modules below are that split, bottom up —

    syshelper   the Swift capture helper: where it lives, what it says
    devices     what this machine offers to record from
    levels      how loud a thing was, and whether audio is still arriving
    mixing      the ffmpeg commands, as pure functions of a recording
    saving      everything after the audio stops: repair, mix, keep, queue
    selfcheck   the test tone, and reading what came back from it

Nothing in that list imports this file. That is deliberate and worth keeping:
the moment one of them needs the live recording, it belongs back in here.
