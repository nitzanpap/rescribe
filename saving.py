"""Everything after the audio stops arriving: repair it, mix it, keep it.

Split out of the recorder because none of it touches the live state. Each function
here takes the recording dict and works on the files named in it, which is what
makes the same path serve two callers that look nothing alike — a recording that
ended because somebody pressed stop, and one rescued from the scratch directory
after the app died mid-meeting. The second is not a special case, it is this same
ending arriving late.

The order matters and is not obvious. Padding comes before mixing, because a
capture that stalled has to get its missing silence back *before* two tracks are
laid against each other — otherwise everything said after the stall sits earlier
in one channel than in the other. Saving comes last, and only ever from a complete
master.
