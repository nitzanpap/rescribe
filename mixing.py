"""The ffmpeg commands: what to record with, and how to put it together after.

One rule runs through all of it, and it was expensive to learn. Nothing is mixed
while it is being recorded. Both sources used to arrive as two live inputs of one
ffmpeg, joined as they came, which meant reconciling two independent clocks in
real time — and `aresample` filled the difference with silence, measured at
0.237 s of it nearly four times a second. That left the louder side intact and
destroyed the quieter one, so a voice came back in pieces too broken for VAD to
consider speech.

So each source is captured alone, into its own file, and combined afterwards from
finished files where there are no clocks left to chase. Everything here is a pure
function of a recording dict: it builds a command and returns it, and running one
is somebody else's job.
